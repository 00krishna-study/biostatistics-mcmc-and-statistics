# Bios 366 Final Project

Bios 366 students are introduced to a range of modern methods for optimization, machine learning, and probabilistic modeling. In addition to the assignments and in-class examples, it is beneficial for practitioners to gain experience using these techniques in a more realistic setting, using data that are collected for use in real-world biostatistical applications. Hence, 50% of the final grade in Bios 366 will be determined by students' performance in a course project.

Students will be allocated to groups of 2 or 3. Each group will be given access to a private GitHub repository containing the project data. Completed projects should be pushed to the repository no later than Dec. 12, 2013. All students in a group will receive the same project grade.

### Prediction of Hospital Death

The `support2.csv` dataset comprises patients from Phases I & II of SUPPORT (Study to Understand Prognoses Preferences Outcomes and Risks of Treatment) by Knauss *et al*. (1995). The dataset includes 46 potential predictor variables, including demographic information, lab results, and physiologic data, along with an indicator for hospital death. *The objective of the Bios 366 course project is to employ modeling tools introduced in this course to fit prediction models for hospital death using the SUPPORT dataset.*

Students may use any of the methods covered in the course syllabus, or any related methods, to develop candidate predictive models. Projects should include at least two alternative approaches, and each approach should be iteratively improved or tuned to yield the most competitive models.

The best projects will:

* include more supporting text than code: fully introduce problem, describe methods, discuss results
* be runnable by anyone with access to the repository
* use cross-validation and/or model selection methods where appropriate to do so
* make appropriate use of visualization tools
* include goodness-of-fit assessments
* report performance characteristics of models
* include opinions and recommendations based on output

The project reports should be pushed to GitHub by the project deadline (Dec. 12). Final projects should be submitted as one or more iPython notebooks.
