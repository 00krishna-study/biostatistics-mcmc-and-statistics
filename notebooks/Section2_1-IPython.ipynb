      "A key component of the everyday workflow of most scientific computing environments is a good interactive environment, that is, a system in which you can execute small amounts of code and view the results immediately, combining both printing out data and opening graphical visualizations.  All modern systems for scientific computing, commercial and open source, include such functionality.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the box, Python also offers a simple interactive shell with very limited capabilities.  But just like the scientific community built Numpy to provide arrays suited for scientific work (since Pytyhon's lists aren't optimal for this task), it has also developed an interactive environment much more sophisticated than the built-in one.  The [IPython project](http://ipython.org) offers a set of tools to make productive use of the Python language, all the while working interactively and with immedate feedback on your results.  The basic tools that IPython provides are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A powerful terminal shell, with many features designed to increase the fluidity and productivity of everyday scientific workflows, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "    * rich introspection of all objects and variables including easy access to the source code of any function\n",
      "    * powerful and extensible tab completion of variables and filenames,\n",
      "    * tight integration with matplotlib, supporting interactive figures that don't block the terminal,\n",
      "    * direct access to the filesystem and underlying operating system,\n",
      "    * an extensible system for shell-like commands called 'magics' that reduce the work needed to perform many common tasks,\n",
      "    * tools for easily running, timing, profiling and debugging your codes,\n",
      "    * syntax highlighted error messages with much more detail than the default Python ones,\n",
      "    * logging and access to all previous history of inputs, including across sessions\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A Qt console that provides the look and feel of a terminal, but adds support for inline figures, graphical calltips, a persistent session that can survive crashes (even segfaults) of the kernel process, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A web-based notebook that can execute code and also contain rich text and figures, mathematical equations and arbitrary HTML. This notebook presents a document-like view with cells where code is executed but that can be edited in-place, reordered, mixed with explanatory text and figures, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. A high-performance, low-latency system for parallel computing that supports the control of a cluster of IPython engines communicating over a network, with optimizations that minimize unnecessary copying of large objects (especially numpy arrays).\n",
      "\n",
      "We will now discuss the highlights of the tools 1-3 above so that you can make them an effective part of your workflow.  The topic of parallel computing is beyond the scope of this document, but we encourage you to read the extensive [documentation](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/rel-0.12.1/parallel/index.html) and [tutorials](http://minrk.github.com/scipy-tutorial-2011/) on this available on the IPython website."
